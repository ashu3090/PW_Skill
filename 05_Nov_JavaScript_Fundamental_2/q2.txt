Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand. A comma operator is used as a separator for multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression. When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression and returns the rightmost expression.

Syntax:

expression1, expression2, expression3

example:

let a = 10, b=33, c= a+b
