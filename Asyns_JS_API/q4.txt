Promises and callbacks are both mechanisms in JavaScript used for handling asynchronous code, but they have significant differences in terms of readability, error handling, and overall code structure. Promises were introduced to address some of the shortcomings of callbacks, making asynchronous code more manageable and easier to understand.
 callbacks are a valid approach for handling asynchronous code, promises offer a more readable, maintainable, and error-resistant alternative. Promises simplify the syntax, improve error handling, and provide a more structured way to manage asynchronous operations, making them the preferred choice for many developers when working with asynchronous code
