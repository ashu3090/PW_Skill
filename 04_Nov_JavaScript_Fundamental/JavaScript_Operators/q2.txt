In JavaScript, we have various types of operators. 
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Assignment Operators
3.Comparison (Relational) Operators
4.Logical Operators
5.Bitwise Operators

Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators perform basic arithmetic operations on the operands. 
example: let a =10,b=4
         let c = a**4
         console.log(c)

Assignment operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
example let a =34434

Comparison operators:
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

example:
let a = 344, b =233
console.log(a==b)
console.log(a===b)
console.log(a>=b)
console.log(a<=b)

Logical operators:
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
