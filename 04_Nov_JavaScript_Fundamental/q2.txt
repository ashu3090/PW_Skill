The use of JavaScript can be both on the client-side and server-side. While HTML and CSS languages are used to give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript is used to add interactive elements that engage users.
For Example
We want to create login feature in website, when we click on login link , a login page will appear.
First we have to use html and Css or Css framework to design a login page, and if we want by clicking op login button a login page will appears, this can be done with JavaScripts
