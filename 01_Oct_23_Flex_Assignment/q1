The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.

Difference Between Grid and Flexbox:

1. Dimensionality and Flexibility:

Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.

2. Alignment:

Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.

When to use CSS Grid or Flex:

1. CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage. You can build complex as well responsive design with this. This is why it is called ‘layout first’.
2. Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.
