Loop:
Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. Types of loop available in javascript are:
    1. for
    2. while
    3. for in
    4. for of
    5. while

for:
Syntax:
        for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

for in:

Syntax:
    for (key in object) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

Example:
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

    let text = "";
    for (let x in person) {
    text += person[x];
    }

for of:

Syntax:
    for (variable of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
    }
Example:

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}

While:
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}


Example:
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
